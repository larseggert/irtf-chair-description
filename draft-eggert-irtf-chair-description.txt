1.  Introduction

   The Internet Research Task Force (IRTF) focuses on longer term
   research issues related to the Internet while the parallel
   organization, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), focuses on
   the shorter term issues of engineering and standards making.

   The IRTF consists of a number of focused and long-term Research
   Groups (RGs).  These groups work on topics related to Internet
   protocols, applications, architecture and technology.  RGs have the
   stable long term membership needed to promote the development of
   research collaboration and teamwork in exploring research issues.
   Individual contributors participate in the IRTF, rather than
   representatives of organizations.

   [RFC2014] details the procedures by which RGs operate.  [RFC4440]
   discusses a view from the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) on the
   IRTF and its relationship to the IETF.  The RFC Editor publishes
   documents from the IRTF and its RGs on the IRTF Stream [RFC5743].

   The IRTF Chair manages the IRTF in consultation with the Internet
   Research Steering Group (IRSG).  The IRSG membership includes the
   IRTF Chair, the chairs of the various RGs and other individuals
   ("members at large") from the research community selected by the IRTF
   Chair.

2.  Duties

   This section discusses the various duties of the IRTF chair and
   outlines the skill set a candidate for the role should ideally have.

Internet-Draft         The Role of the IRTF Chair           January 2016


2.1.  Administrative

   A good fraction of the duties of the IRTF Chair are administrative.
   Some of them may be permanently or temporarily delegated to other
   IRSG members, but they ultimately always remain the IRTF Chair's
   responsibility.

   Some of those related to publishing documents on the IRTF RFC Stream,
   such as ensuring sufficient review, so that documents published are
   of good quality, scheduling the required Internet Engineering
   Steering Group (IESG) review [RFC5742], and following up with the
   IESG, IANA and the RFC Editor during and after the publication
   process.

   Other administrative duties include reviewing and approving requests
   from the RGs for time slots during IETF meetings or interim meetings
   elsewhere, ensuring that meeting materials are submitted on schedule,
   maintaining the IRTF web site, and - in cooperation with the RG
   chairs - ensuring that the IETF datatracker correctly reflects the
   status of the various IRTF-related documents.

   The IRTF Chair also needs to appoint, replace and manage the RG
   chairs and the IRSG, and follow the research work of the chartered
   and proposed RGs to a degree that is sufficient to let them develop
   an understanding on whether they are generally operating well.

   The IRTF Chair also defines the operational procedures for the IRTF
   (in the boundaries defined by [RFC2014]) and the IRSG.  At the
   moment, these procedures are captures as a set of wiki pages
   [IRTFWIKI] and it is the duty of the IRTF Chair to refine and update
   them.

   The IRSG tries to schedule a working dinner during each IETF meeting,
   and the IRTF Chair is responsible for organizing the agenda and a
   suitable venue.

   The IRTF Chair writes a regular column for the IETF Journal
   [IETFJOURNAL] on recent IRTF-related events.

   These administrative duties are very similar to part of the duties of
   an Area Director (AD) in the IETF and require the same set of
   organizational and communication skills [IESGEXP].  They also require
   a regular time commitment throughout the year, the ability to attend
   most of the IETF meetings in person, as well as some other related
   travel.

   The IRTF Chair regularly interacts with the ADs and the IESG for
   document reviews, IETF meeting agenda planning, and often provides

Internet-Draft         The Role of the IRTF Chair           January 2016


   input on various IETF efforts and topics.  The IRTF Chair also
   regularly interacts with the IETF Administrative Oversight Committee
   (IAOC) and the IETF Secretariat for meeting planning, budgeting and
   other organizational purposes.  In addition, the IRTF Chair also
   interacts with the Tools Team to provide input on how IETF tools can
   best support the operation of the IRTF.  Finally, the IRTF Chair is
   the owner of the IRTF RFC Stream and is hence part of the group that
   reviews the RFC Editor's performance and operation; and engages with
   the Independent Stream Editor in cases where submissions on that RFC
   Stream have relationships to the IRTF.  A good working relationship
   with all these individuals and bodies is important.

2.2.  Strategic

   Arguably the more important part of the duties of the IRTF Chair are
   strategic, and concern shaping of the purpose and scope of the IRTF,
   by making decisions about which RGs to charter, which RGs to
   terminate, and which other activities or efforts the IRTF should
   organize or affiliate itself with.

   For some new RGs, the research and engineering community brings a
   proposal to the IRTF Chair for discussion.  However, it is common for
   the IRTF Chair to identify a new area of research that is considered
   of importance to the Internet, actively motivate people in the
   research and engineering community to consider the formation of an
   RG, and help them navigate the process for doing so.

   In order to be able to fulfill this duty, it is important for the
   IRTF Chair to be involved in both the academic research community as
   well as engineering or operational communities.  Without a
   demonstrated history of participation in these often somewhat
   isolated communities it will be very difficult to identify areas of
   academic research that are suitable for being brought into the IRTF.
   A good network of contacts in these communities will be very helpful
   in identifying and motivating potential RG chairs and participants.

   Involvement in the academic research community can be demonstrated
   through a publication record, membership in conference program and
   organizational committees, participation in publicly funded
   collaborative research projects, among others.

   The Applied Networking Research Prize (ANRP) is a joint award of the
   Internet Society (ISOC) and an example of a strategic initiative that
   since its inception in 2011 now turned into more of an administrative
   duty.  The IRTF Chair and an ISOC representative pick and chair the
   ANRP selection committee, which advertises the ANRP, encourages
   community nominations for the prizes, and reviews nominations and
   selects prize winners.  To serve in this role, the IRTF Chair also

Internet-Draft         The Role of the IRTF Chair           January 2016


   relies on strong ties to the academic research community, to identify
   suitable selection committee members and to encourage nominations for
   suitable work that is published in a given year.  The selection
   committee operates similar to a program committee for an academic
   conference (more specifically, it performs a function similar to the
   selection of a best paper award).  It is therefore useful if the IRTF
   Chair has firsthand experience serving on program committees, and
   ideally, chairing them.

2.3.  IAB Membership

   The IRTF Chair serves as an "ex officio" member of the IAB [RFC2850],
   and is expected to participate in IAB discussions and activities.
   This duty benefits from expertise that is similar to those of full
   IAB members [IABEXP], and requires a similar time and travel
   commitment, for example, to attend IAB Retreats and relevant IAB
   workshops.
